## GardenVille App
### Developers 

Getting started 

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16.x` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.14.x` are installed on your system.

Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

```sh
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings
npm start # Start the development server
```

**Example calls to ledger and backend canisters:**

```sh
% dfx canister call icrc_ledger icrc1_balance_of '(record {owner=principal "k66gq-mwaa4-arqxk-cwijt-oixji-hilid-2umca-4edmd-v2qzt-w2ezk-pae"; subaccount=null})'

(100 : nat)

% dfx canister call backend getBalance '(principal "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai", record{owner=principal "k66gq-mwaa4-arqxk-cwijt-oixji-hilid-2umca-4edmd-v2qzt-w2ezk-pae"; subaccount=null})'

(variant { Ok = 100 : int })
```
```sh
% dfx canister call icrc_ledger icrc1_metadata
(
  vec {
    record { "icrc1:decimals"; variant { Nat = 8 : nat } };
    record { "icrc1:name"; variant { Text = "GardenVilleToken" } };
    record { "icrc1:symbol"; variant { Text = "XGVT" } };
    record { "icrc1:fee"; variant { Nat = 0 : nat } };
    record { "icrc1:max_memo_length"; variant { Nat = 32 : nat } };
  },
)
```
Burn: transfer to minter:
```sh
% dfx identity use minter
% dfx canister call icrc_ledger icrc1_transfer '(record {to=record {owner=principal "xo4dp-vrysm-ccbiv-4vjrp-pvkw2-buqld-4sjp5-trjzx-cmh4p-i5pex-gqe"; subaccount=null}; fee=null; memo=null; from_subaccount=null; created_at_time=null; amount=100})'

(variant { Ok = 4 : nat })
```

## Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
